Once that is done, you may:

* Follow the [setup steps here](https://v7.amadeusweb.com/getting-started/) for setting up the open source tools we use on your machine. Yes, AmadeusWeb is an offline approach to web building and this has many advantages.

* Create a github account and start on your own site as either [a standalone](http://demo.amadeusweb.site/) or [a network](http://network-demo.amadeusweb.site/)

Then reach out to us for assistance in developing, or if we have already discussed that yours is to be a member of "AmadeusWeb.world" then the setup is for a "[Section/Site](https://github.com/AmadeusWebInAction/daivism)" like [Daivism](https://amadeusweb.world/).
